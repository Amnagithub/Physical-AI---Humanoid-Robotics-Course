# Weekly Breakdown

## Meta-Structure: Mapping Weeks to Modules

This document provides the meta-structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course, mapping the 13-week semester to the core modules. This breakdown ensures comprehensive coverage of Physical AI concepts while allowing sufficient time for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

### Week 1–2: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System
- Introduction to Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Fundamentals of robotic control systems
- Basic sensor integration and feedback control
- ROS 2 fundamentals and communication patterns
- Hands-on: Basic robot control and navigation

### Week 3–5: Module 1 (Advanced) - Advanced Robotic Control
- Advanced control theory for physical systems
- State estimation and filtering techniques
- Trajectory planning and execution
- Multi-robot coordination and communication
- Hands-on: Advanced control challenges and optimization

### Week 6–7: Module 2 - Digital Twin & Simulation
- Principles of digital twin technology
- Physics simulation for robotics
- System identification and modeling
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques
- Hands-on: Creating and validating digital twins

### Week 8–10: Module 3 - Perception & Computer Vision
- Multimodal perception systems
- Computer vision for robotics applications
- Sensor fusion and state estimation
- 3D perception and scene understanding
- Hands-on: Perception system implementation and validation

### Week 11–13: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & GPT Integration
- Vision-Language-Action systems for embodied AI
- Large language models for cognitive planning
- Voice control and natural interaction
- Integration of perception, planning, and action
- Capstone project: Complete Physical AI system implementation

## Notes for Instructors

- **Flexibility**: The advanced Module 1 content (Weeks 3-5) can be adjusted based on student background and progress
- **Integration**: Throughout the course, students should be encouraged to connect concepts across modules
- **Assessment**: Each module includes both formative assessments (weekly challenges) and summative assessments (module projects)
- **Hardware**: Consider hardware availability when scheduling hands-on activities
- **Prerequisites**: Students should complete "Why Physical AI Matters" before Week 1
- **Capstone**: The final weeks emphasize integration, with students applying all previous learning to create a complete Physical AI system

## Learning Progression

The weekly breakdown is designed to build complexity gradually:
- **Foundation**: Weeks 1-5 establish core robotic control capabilities
- **Modeling**: Weeks 6-7 introduce simulation and modeling tools
- **Perception**: Weeks 8-10 develop sensory understanding
- **Integration**: Weeks 11-13 combine all elements into complete systems

This progression ensures students develop both the technical skills and conceptual understanding necessary for advanced Physical AI applications.
