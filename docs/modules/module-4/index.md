# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This is where Physical AI becomes truly interactive! This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots, covering voice control, LLM-based planning, and autonomous humanoid capstone projects. You'll learn how to create intelligent systems that can interpret voice commands, plan cognitive tasks using Large Language Models, and execute complex behaviors in a safe and explainable manner.

Before diving into this interactive module, please ensure you have reviewed:
- [Why Physical AI Matters](../../course/why-physical-ai-matters.md) to understand the philosophical foundation
- [Hardware Requirements](../../course/hardware-requirements.md) for the necessary infrastructure
- [Lab Architecture & Deployment Models](../../course/lab-architecture.md) to understand system design considerations

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement Voice-to-Action systems using speech and perception models
- Design cognitive planning systems with Large Language Models
- Translate natural language goals into ROS 2 action sequences
- Build and test an autonomous humanoid robot system
- Understand safety considerations and explainability in autonomous systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Voice Control and Speech Recognition**
   - Speech recognition fundamentals
   - OpenAI Whisper integration
   - Voice command processing pipeline
   - Multimodal action creation (voice + vision)
   - ROS 2 action server integration

2. **Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with Large Language Models**
   - Natural language goal parsing
   - LLM-based task decomposition
   - ROS 2 action sequence generation
   - Cognitive reasoning with LLMs
   - Safety and validation for LLM plans

3. **Chapter 3: Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project**
   - VLA system integration approach
   - Complete system architecture
   - Safety and error handling for autonomous systems
   - Explainability and monitoring for autonomous robots
   - Capstone project requirements and implementation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Access to computing resources for simulation environments
- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 concepts
- OpenAI API access for Whisper and LLM functionality
- Understanding of basic speech recognition concepts (helpful but not required)

## Estimated Duration

This module requires approximately 6-8 hours of study to complete all chapters and exercises.

## Next Steps

Begin with [Chapter 1: Voice Control and Speech Recognition](./chapter-1-voice-control.md) to learn about voice-to-action systems.

Continue to [Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with Large Language Models](./chapter-2-llm-planning.md) to explore LLM-based planning.

Complete the module with [Chapter 3: Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project](./chapter-3-autonomous-capstone.md) to integrate all VLA concepts.
