# Glossary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## A

**Action Sequence**: An ordered list of robot actions that are executed as a unit, with defined start and end states.

**Autonomous System**: A robot system that can operate independently, making decisions and executing tasks without direct human intervention.

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**: Advanced AI models trained on vast text corpora that can understand and generate human-like language for various tasks.

**LLM Planner**: A cognitive system that translates high-level natural language goals into structured task sequences for robot execution.

## R

**ROS 2 Action**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks that includes feedback and status updates during execution.

**Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, and message passing.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: An integrated system combining computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action execution for intelligent robot behavior.

**Voice Command**: Natural language input processed by speech recognition systems to trigger specific robot behaviors.

**Voice-to-Action Pipeline**: The complete processing chain from speech recognition to robot action execution.

## W

**Whisper**: OpenAI's automatic speech recognition system used for converting spoken language into text.

## S

**Speech Recognition**: The technology that converts spoken language into text format for further processing.

**Safety Validation**: The process of ensuring that autonomous robot systems operate safely and handle errors appropriately.

## E

**Explainability**: The ability of an AI system to provide understandable explanations for its decisions and actions to human users.

**Error Handling**: The systematic approach to detecting, managing, and recovering from errors in autonomous systems.

## T

**Task Decomposition**: The process of breaking down complex goals into smaller, executable subtasks.

**Task Sequencing**: The organization of individual robot actions into ordered sequences for goal achievement.
