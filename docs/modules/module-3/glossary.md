# Glossary: The AI-Robot Brain for Humanoid Robotics

## A

**Acceptable Motion Constraint (AMC)**: Constraints that define the limits of safe and stable humanoid motion.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## B

**Balance Controller**: A control system that maintains the stability of a humanoid robot during motion.

**Bipedal Locomotion**: The act of walking on two legs, as in humanoid robots.

## C

**Center of Mass (CoM)**: The point in a body where the total mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated.

**Collision Avoidance**: The ability of a robot to detect and avoid obstacles in its path.

## D

**Dynamic Balance**: Maintaining balance while the robot is in motion.

## E

**Environment Mapping**: Creating a representation of the robot's surroundings.

## F

**Footstep Planning**: Planning where to place the feet of a bipedal robot to maintain balance and achieve a goal.

## G

**Global Planner**: A path planning algorithm that finds an optimal path from start to goal in a known map.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with a human-like form, typically having a head, torso, arms, and legs.

## I

**Inverted Pendulum Model**: A simplified model of balance control where the robot is treated as an inverted pendulum.

## K

**Kinematics**: The study of motion without considering the forces that cause the motion.

## L

**Local Planner**: A path planning algorithm that adjusts the global plan based on local sensor information and obstacles.

## M

**Motion Planning**: The task of finding a sequence of valid configurations to move from an initial to a goal state.

## N

**Navigation**: The ability of a robot to move through an environment from one location to another.

**Navigation Framework**: A software system that provides tools and algorithms for robot navigation.

## P

**Path Planning**: The process of determining a route from a starting point to a destination.

**Perception**: The ability of a robot to sense and interpret its environment.

## S

**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

**Simulation**: The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.

**Synthetic Data**: Artificially generated data that mimics real-world sensor inputs for AI model training.

## V

**Visual SLAM (VSLAM)**: SLAM that uses visual sensors (cameras) as the primary sensor modality.

## Z

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: A point on the ground where the net moment of the ground reaction forces is zero.
