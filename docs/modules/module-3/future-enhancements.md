### Integration Improvements
- **ROS 2 Integration**: Provide more detailed examples of how to integrate with ROS 2 systems
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Add information about compatibility with different humanoid platforms (NAO, Pepper, Atlas, etc.)
- **Simulation Software**: Expand coverage to include more simulation environments (Gazebo, Webots, Mujoco)

## Known Limitations

### Current Scope
- The module focuses on fundamental concepts rather than cutting-edge research
- Mathematical depth is limited to ensure accessibility
- Some advanced optimization techniques are not covered in detail

### Technical Limitations
- Code examples are illustrative rather than production-ready
- Performance optimization examples are basic
- Hardware-specific considerations are generalized

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Students
1. Implement the examples in a real simulation environment
2. Experiment with different humanoid robot models
3. Explore advanced topics in the suggested readings
4. Join robotics communities and forums for continued learning

### For Instructors
1. Customize examples for specific hardware platforms
2. Add domain-specific applications relevant to students' interests
3. Integrate with hands-on laboratory exercises
4. Connect with other robotics educators to share resources
