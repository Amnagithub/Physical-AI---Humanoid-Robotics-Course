# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on the AI systems that power humanoid robots, covering simulation, navigation, and motion planning. You'll learn how to create intelligent systems that enable humanoid robots to perceive, navigate, and interact with their environments.

Before diving into this module, please ensure you have reviewed:
- [Why Physical AI Matters](../../course/why-physical-ai-matters.md) to understand the philosophical foundation
- [Hardware Requirements](../../course/hardware-requirements.md) for the necessary infrastructure
- [Lab Architecture & Deployment Models](../../course/lab-architecture.md) to understand system design considerations

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Create high-fidelity simulations for humanoid robot development
- Implement Visual SLAM (VSLAM) and navigation pipelines
- Plan and execute bipedal humanoid motion using navigation frameworks
- Generate synthetic datasets for AI training
- Integrate perception, navigation, and motion systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Photorealistic Simulation and Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Creating high-fidelity simulation environments
   - Generating synthetic datasets for AI training
   - Photorealistic rendering techniques

2. **Chapter 2: Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM and Navigation**
   - Visual SLAM fundamentals and algorithms
   - Environment mapping and localization
   - Navigation pipeline implementation

3. **Chapter 3: Path Planning and Bipedal Humanoid Movement**
   - Navigation frameworks for humanoid robots
   - Bipedal motion constraints and dynamics
   - Safe and efficient path planning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with programming concepts
- Access to appropriate computing hardware for robotics simulation

## Estimated Duration

This module requires approximately 4-6 hours of study to complete all chapters and exercises.
