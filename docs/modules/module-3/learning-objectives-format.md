# Learning Objectives Format

This document defines the consistent format for learning objectives across all chapters in Module 3.

## Format

Learning objectives should be written in the following format:

- Use action verbs that are measurable (e.g., "explain", "implement", "analyze", "create", "demonstrate")
- Be specific and clear about what the student will be able to do
- Be achievable within the scope of the chapter
- Be relevant to the chapter's main topic

## Examples

### Good Learning Objectives
- "Explain the principles of photorealistic rendering in robotics simulation"
- "Implement a basic VSLAM pipeline using robotics middleware"
- "Analyze the constraints of bipedal locomotion in humanoid robots"
- "Create a synthetic dataset with proper annotations for AI training"

### Avoid
- "Understand robotics concepts" (too vague)
- "Learn about simulation" (too general)
- "Know the theory of navigation" (not action-oriented)

## Structure

Each chapter should have 3-5 learning objectives that follow this pattern:

1. Knowledge objective: What students will understand conceptually
2. Application objective: What students will be able to implement
3. Analysis objective: What students will be able to evaluate or compare
4. Synthesis objective: What students will be able to create or design (if applicable)
5. Evaluation objective: What students will be able to assess or justify (if applicable)
