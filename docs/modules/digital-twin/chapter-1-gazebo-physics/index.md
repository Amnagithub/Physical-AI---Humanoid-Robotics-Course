# Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation

In this chapter, you will learn how to simulate humanoid robots in Gazebo with a focus on physics, gravity, collisions, and humanoid dynamics. Gazebo is the standard physics simulator in robotics with extensive ROS integration, making it ideal for understanding the fundamental principles of robotic simulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo for humanoid robot simulation
- Understand the physics concepts of gravity, collisions, and dynamics in simulation
- Create and simulate humanoid dynamics in a controlled environment
- Apply forces and observe realistic movement and interaction with the environment

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. [Gazebo Setup and Installation](./setup.md) - Configure your environment for Gazebo simulation
2. [Physics Concepts](./physics-concepts.md) - Learn about gravity, collisions, and dynamics
3. [Humanoid Dynamics in Simulation](./humanoid-dynamics.md) - Explore how humanoid robots behave in simulated physics environments
4. [Practical Exercises](./exercises.md) - Apply your knowledge with hands-on exercises

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Access to a computer capable of running Gazebo (or cloud-based alternatives)
