# Contract Documentation for The AI-Robot Brain for Humanoid Robotics

This module is a documentation project for a Docusaurus-based book on humanoid robotics. As such, there are no traditional API contracts. Instead, the "contracts" for this module are:

## Content Interface Contracts

### Chapter Structure Contract
- Each chapter must include learning objectives
- Each chapter must contain practical examples
- Each chapter must have a summary section
- Each chapter must include exercises for students

### Content Format Contract
- All content must be in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown
- Code examples must be properly formatted with syntax highlighting
- All diagrams and images must be accessible
- Cross-references between chapters must be valid

### Quality Contract
- All technical information must be accurate
- Examples must be reproducible
- Content must follow accessibility guidelines
- Navigation must be intuitive and consistent

## Documentation Standards Contract

### Markdown Standards
- Frontmatter must include title and sidebar_label
- Headings must follow proper hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Code blocks must specify language for syntax highlighting
- Links must be relative for internal navigation

### Educational Standards
- Concepts must be explained in progressive complexity
- Examples must include expected output
- Exercises must have clear instructions
- Solutions must be provided for self-assessment

These contracts ensure consistency and quality across all chapters in Module 3.
