# Chapter 3: Humanoid Sensor Simulation

In this chapter, you will learn how to configure and interpret simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) in digital twin environments for humanoid robots. Sensor simulation is critical for developing perception algorithms without requiring physical hardware, allowing for safe and reproducible testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand different types of sensors used in humanoid robotics
- Configure simulated sensors in digital twin environments
- Interpret simulated sensor data streams
- Develop perception algorithms using simulated data

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. [Sensor Types Guide](./sensor-types.md) - Overview of LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
2. [Sensor Configuration Guide](./config-guide.md) - How to set up sensors in simulation environments
3. [Data Interpretation Guide](./data-interpretation.md) - Understanding and processing sensor outputs
4. [Practical Exercises](./exercises.md) - Apply your knowledge with hands-on exercises

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Understanding of basic physics and mathematics
- Familiarity with simulation environments (Gazebo/Unity)
- Basic programming knowledge for data processing
