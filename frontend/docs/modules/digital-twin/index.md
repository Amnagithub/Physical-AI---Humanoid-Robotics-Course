# The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on digital twin technologies using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization and interaction.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- How to simulate humanoid robots in Gazebo with realistic physics
- How to create immersive environments using Unity
- How to configure and interpret simulated sensor data

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments
- Access to Gazebo and Unity (or cloud-based alternatives)

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation](./chapter-1-gazebo-physics/index.md) - Learn about physics, gravity, collisions, and humanoid dynamics in Gazebo
2. [Chapter 2: Unity Environments and Interaction](./chapter-2-unity-env/index.md) - Explore high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
3. [Chapter 3: Humanoid Sensor Simulation](./chapter-3-sensor-sim/index.md) - Understand how to configure and interpret simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
